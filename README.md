FurryTail Launcher
Hi, I’m Leander. I started building FurryTail Launcher because I wanted to create something that felt more personal than the usual Minecraft experience. I’m just a teen working on this in my free time, but I care a lot about making something that brings people together — especially those who don’t always feel at home in mainstream gaming spaces.
FurryTail Launcher is based on MultiMC, but it’s more than just a launcher. It’s meant to be a cozy, inclusive space for furries, femboys, catboys, catgirls, and anyone else who vibes with that energy. I wanted to build something that reflects the kind of community I wish existed more often: friendly, expressive, and open-minded.
What I’m working on
This project is still in early development, but here’s what I’m planning:
- Built-in voice chat so you can talk directly while playing
- A better-looking launcher with custom themes
- Discord integration to stay connected with the community
- A cleaner, more useful website
- Support for mods and more customization
- And lots of other ideas I’m excited to explore
Download
The launcher isn’t ready for public release yet, but I’ve started packaging it for Linux. If you’re on Debian or Ubuntu, you’ll be able to download it here once it’s ready:
Download furrytaillauncher_0.0.1-1_amd64.deb
Other platforms will come later.
Want to support or join in?
This is a solo project, but I’d love to have people involved — whether that’s testing, giving feedback, or just hanging out. Here’s where you can find me and the community:
- Patreon — if you want to support development
- Discord — for chatting, updates, and feedback
- Reddit — for discussions and news
Thanks for checking this out. I’m building this because I believe in it, and I hope you’ll find something here that feels good to be part of.
— Leander
